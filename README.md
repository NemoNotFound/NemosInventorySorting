# Description
**Nemo's Inventory Sorting** is a _client-side_ mod that adds buttons to your inventory GUI.  
Sort your inventory, move all matching or all items, or drop everything at once â€” all with a single click.

You can even filter and highlight items in containers by typing part of their name!
Quickly filter items by pressing **Ctrl + F** (or **Command + F** on macOS).    
You can change the key binding in the settings.

For more information and to see how to configure the components check the [wiki](https://wiki.devnemo.com/projects/minecraft-mods/nemos-inventory-sorting/general).

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** If you're a dark mode enthusiast, you can use the built-in dark mode resource pack.

### How to Use
To sort, drop or move items, simply click the buttons or set custom key binds and press them.   
In the player inventory, clicking the buttons does not include the hotbar. To include the hotbar, Shift-click (or Shift + key bind).    
To search for an item, simply click the search bar or press **Ctrl + [Key Bind]** (or **Command + [Key Bind]** on macOS), then start typing!

### âš  Disclaimer   

This is a **client-only mod**, which means it can give you an advantage over other players.  
Using it on public servers *may* get you banned depending on the serverâ€™s rules.  
Use at your own risk â€” or check with the server admins beforehand.
