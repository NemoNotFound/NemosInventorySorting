# Description
Nemo's Inventory Sorting is a client-only mod that adds buttons to inventories to sort items.
Sort your inventory from A-Z, Z-A, move all items at once, or drop the entire inventory with just a button click.
<br><br>
**Note:** If you suffer from color blindness, you can use the built-in dark mode resource pack.
<br>

### DISCLAIMER <br>
This mod works on the client side only, which gives you an advantage over other players. <br>
I can't guarantee that you won't get banned from public servers when using this mod on them. <br>
Use on public servers at your own risk or ask a server admin.
