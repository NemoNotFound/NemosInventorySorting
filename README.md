# Description
Nemo's Inventory Sorting is a **client-side** mod that adds buttons to inventories for sorting items.
Sort your inventory from A-Z, Z-A, move all items at once, or drop your entire inventory with a single button click.
Also highlight items in containers by typing the name!

For more information and to see how to configure the components check the [wiki](https://github.com/NemoNotFound/NemosInventorySorting/wiki).

**Note:** If you're a dark mode enthusiast, you can use the built-in dark mode resource pack.
<br>

### How to Use
To sort, drop or move items, simply click the buttons or set custom key binds and press them.
In the player inventory, clicking the buttons does not include the hotbar. To include the hotbar, Shift-click (or Shift + key bind). <br>
To search for an item, simply click the search bar and start typing!

### DISCLAIMER <br>
This mod works on the **client side only**, which gives you an advantage over other players. <br>
I cannot guarantee that you wonâ€™t get banned from public servers for using it. <br>
**Use on public servers at your own risk** or ask a server admin.
