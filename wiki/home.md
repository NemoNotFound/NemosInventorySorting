# Description

**Nemo's Inventory Sorting** is a *client-side* mod that adds buttons to your inventory GUI.  
Sort your inventory Aâ€“Z or Zâ€“A, move all matching or all items, or drop everything at once â€” all with a single click.  
You can even filter and highlight items in containers by typing part of their name!

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** If you're a dark mode enthusiast, you can use the built-in dark mode resource pack.

Use at your own risk â€” or check with the server admins beforehand.
