# Sorting
With Nemo's Inventory Sorting, you have buttons to sort items from A-Z, Z-A, move the same or all items, and drop items. <br>
There are two ways to use these buttons:

## Mouse
Simply click the buttons or shift-click them to include items in the hotbar.

## Keyboard
First, you need to set the key binds. They are not bound by default. You can find them under the key bind settings. <br>
Now you can press the configured key bind or shift-press it to include items in the hotbar.
